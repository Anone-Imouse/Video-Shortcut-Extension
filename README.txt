Video-Shortcut-Extension

This is a pretty cool, simple extension meant mainly for video elements it HTML. But trust me, there's more.

For Picture-In-Picture, you have to click the shortcut: "Ctrl" + "Shift" + "P". 
Make sure you are holding these keys at the same time, and in this order.
However, for automatic scroll, you have to enter the shortcut "Ctrl" + "Shift" + "S" and to end it, simply click the "s" key once again
