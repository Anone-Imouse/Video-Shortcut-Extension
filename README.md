# Video-Shortcut-Extension
This is a pretty cool, simple extension meant mainly for video elements it HTML. But trust me, there's more.

For Picture-In-Picture, you have to click the shortcut: "ctrl" + "shift" + "p". Make sure you are holding these keys at the same time, and in this order.
For Fullscreen, which works for canvases, iframes and video click "ctrl" + "shift" + "f". The same conditions apply as the piture in picture
