# Video-Shortcut-Extension
This is a pretty cool, simple extension meant mainly for video elements it HTML. But trust me, there's more.

For Picture-In-Picture, you have to click the shortcut: <code>Ctrl</code> + <code>Shift</code> + <code>P</code>. Make sure you are holding these keys at the same time, and in this order.
However, for automatic scroll, you have to enter the shortcut <code>Ctrl</code> + <code>Shift</code> + <code>S</code> and to end it, simply click the <code>S</code> key once again
